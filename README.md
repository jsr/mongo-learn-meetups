# The MongoDB Meetups Learning Application
The meetups project is a sample application built in Java using the [Play Framework](http://www.playframework.org/) backed by [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org/). The app is meant to allow people to post and find upcoming meetups (or *events*, if you prefer).

The idea is to help people learn or familiarize themselves with MongoDB. 

Accompanying the application the complete [Guide](https://github.com/jsr/mongo-learn-meetups/wiki)] which takes a step by step approach to building the application. You can dive into the finished application, residing on the master branch, or [download a tag](https://github.com/jsr/mongo-learn-meetups/downloads) and build alongside the guide.
